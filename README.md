# PET-CARE-CHARITY
This study attempts to describe the procedure and significance of handling donation data for an annual 
fundraising campaign for a pet rescue organisation. The nonprofit, which is dedicated to saving and 
caring for animals in need, organises a citywide campaign to gather money for their admirable cause. 
The donation drive entails segmenting the city into donation areas, allocating committed teams of 
volunteers to each area, and requesting money from locals by going door to door.
Each volunteer received six postal codes for a specific region. These dedicated volunteers are tasked 
with gathering donations made by locals in the form of cash, cheques, or credit card payments. To 
ensure data accuracy and reliability, each group leader compiles a weekly donation record that is then 
sent to the charity's head office.
The various elements of donation data management and analysis will be covered in more detail in the 
sections that follow. It will go over the procedures for gathering, validating, and loading data as well as 
the many analytical methods that can be used to glean useful information. The paper will also examine 
the possible advantages of effective data management, such as better decision-making, focused 
fundraising, and better resource allocation.
